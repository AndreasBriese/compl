## Completion  for the Go programming language in p9p acme editor

Mostly forked from https://github.com/nsf/gocode
Options for vim, emacs etc. cleaned.

### Usage

Executing (MiddleMouseButton) 'compl' in tag window of existing .go file should insert at 'dot' and open +completions window. RightMouseButton on token in that window should insert.
Undo surely works.

Closing +completion window should close client.
Daemon should be closed explicitly.
See README_original.md for detail (assuming 'Edit , x/gocode/ c/compl')
